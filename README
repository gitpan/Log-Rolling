Log-Rolling

Log::Rolling is a module designed to give programs lightweight, yet
powerful logging facilities.  One of the primary benefits is that, while the
logs I<can> be infinitely long and handled by something like C<logrotate>,
the module is capable of limiting the number of lines in the log in a fashion
where by the oldest lines roll off to keep the size constant at the maximum
allowed size, if so tuned.

This module is particularly useful when you need to keep logs around for a 
certain amount of available data, but do not need to incur the complexity
and overhead of using something as heavy as C<logrotate> or other methods
of archiving.  Since the rolling is built into the logging facility, no
extra cron jobs or the like are necessary.

Data is buffered throughout the run of a program with each call to C<entry()>.
Once C<commit()> is called, that buffer is written to the log file, and the
log buffer is cleared.  The C<commit()> method may be called as many times as
necessary; however, it is best to do so as few times as required due to the
overhead of file operations involved in rolling the log--hence the reason the
entries are stored in memory until manually committed in the first place.
